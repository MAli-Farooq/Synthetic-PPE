#Synthetic PPE Dataset Generation

This repository contains a synthetic dataset of personal protective equipment (PPE) images generated using advanced diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion 1.5 and Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL). The dataset was curated using four distinct sampling methods to ensure diversity and quality: Euler, Euler A, DDIM, and DPM++.

Our work aims to provide novel synthetic data for research and applications in safety equipment detection, classification, and other related fields.
