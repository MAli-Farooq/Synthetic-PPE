# Synthetic PPE Dataset Generation

This repository contains a synthetic dataset of personal protective equipment (PPE) images generated using advanced diffusion models, including **Stable Diffusion 1.5** and **Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)**. 

## Key Features
- **Models Used**: Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL.
- **Sampling Methods**: 
  - Euler
  - Euler A
  - DDIM
  - DPM++

Our work aims to provide quality synthetic data for research and applications in safety equipment detection, classification, and other related fields.
